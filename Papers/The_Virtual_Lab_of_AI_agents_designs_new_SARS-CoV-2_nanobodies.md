# Summary of "The Virtual Lab of AI agents designs new SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies"

This is a peer-reviewed paper accepted for publication in Nature (July 2025) that introduces the "Virtual Lab," an AI-human research collaboration framework designed to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary scientific research.

## Key Components and Architecture

The Virtual Lab consists of:
- An LLM (Large Language Model) principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents
- A human researcher providing high-level feedback
- Two meeting formats: team meetings (all agents discussing broad research questions) and individual meetings (single agent tackling specific tasks)
- A Scientific Critic agent that challenges assumptions and pinpoints errors, serving as the lab's skeptical reviewer

## Case Study: Nanobody Design for SARS-CoV-2

The authors applied the Virtual Lab to design nanobodies that can bind to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 (including KP.3), demonstrating real-world scientific impact. The process involved:

1. **Team selection**: Creating specialized AI agents (Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist)
2. **Project specification**: Deciding to modify existing nanobodies rather than create new ones
3. **Tools selection**: Choosing ESM (protein language model), AlphaFold-Multimer (protein folding), and Rosetta (computational biology software)
4. **Tools implementation**: Writing code for each component
5. **Workflow design**: Creating a pipeline to modify nanobodies through iterative point mutations

## Results

The Virtual Lab designed 92 nanobody candidates, starting from four existing nanobodies (Ty1, H11-D4, Nb21, VHH-72) known to bind the ancestral Wuhan strain. Experimental validation showed:

- Over 90% of designed nanobodies were expressed and soluble
- Two promising nanobodies showed improved binding profiles:
  1. A mutated Nb21 (I77V-L59E-Q87A-R37Q) with improved binding to JN.1 and gained binding to KP.3
  2. A mutated Ty1 (V32F-G59D-N54S-F32S) that gained binding to JN.1

## Key Innovations and Implications

- The Virtual Lab completed its design in just a few days, compared to potentially weeks for a human researcher working independently
- The human researcher only provided 1.3% of the total words in the workflow (just 1,596 words), with AI agents contributing 98.7% (over 120,000 words)
- The multi-agent architecture allowed for interdisciplinary perspectives and comprehensive solutions
- To improve consistency and avoid hallucinations, the system uses parallel meetings run at high "temperature" (more randomness), followed by a low-temperature merge meeting
- This approach could democratize access to interdisciplinary scientific research for under-resourced groups
- The success rates are similar to those from traditional human-led projects but required significantly less time and potentially lower costs

## Future Directions

- Integration with robotic lab systems could create fully autonomous research pipelines
- Companies like Emerald Cloud Lab, Strateos, and others are already developing robotic wet-lab-as-a-service platforms
- An integrated AI-robotics system could run experiments 24/7 without fatigue, conducting hundreds or thousands of micro-experiments in parallel
- This represents a fundamental shift in how we conduct scientific research, with AI systems not just answering questions but asking, arguing, debating, and discovering

## Limitations

- LLMs may not be aware of the most up-to-date scientific literature (knowledge cutoff)
- Need for prompt engineering to obtain useful answers
- Potential for LLMs to provide incorrect information (hallucinations)
- Real-world science is messy and nonlinear, requiring robust protocols and human judgment for unexpected errors

The authors suggest this framework could be applied to many other scientific domains, enabling human researchers to engage in complex interdisciplinary science even without access to a panel of human experts.
